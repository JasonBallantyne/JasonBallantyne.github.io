My name is Jason Ballantyne, I am currently a Cyber Security Data Engineer at Dell. I have an MSc in Computer Science from UCD and a natural enthusiasm for data. 

Prior to my studies in Computer Science, I worked as a Data Analyst and Product Analyst in the financial industry. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for drawing actionable insights through data analytical solutions which in turn led me to pursue a full time Computer Science masters.

If you have any questions about the UCD MSc in Computer Science, future opportunities, or would just like to connect, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-ballantyne)!
