Developing the specifications of a robust and effective track-and-trace mobile app that can reliably provide the data needed to stop the spread of the virus. 
There are numerous complications of such an undertaking, and they all must be considered throughout the development process.
There are a number of high level requirements:
- Hardware: The app must run on all common mobile devices.
- Identity: The user and those around the user must be represented anonymously
and securely.
- Proximity: The app must be able to identify encounters with other phone users. Again, security concerns must be addressed with this functionality.
- Communication: Data must be shared and processed securely.
- Hotspots: The app should show information about local hotspots to the user andwarn them if they approach too closely.
- Motivations: Users need to trust the app to use it.
